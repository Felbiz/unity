================================================================================
                        IMPORTANT REMINDERS
================================================================================

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:
‚Ä¢ Backup your project regularly (use Git or manual backups)
‚Ä¢ Keep your Android keystore file safe (you can't update app without it!)
‚Ä¢ Test on actual Android devices, not just Unity editor
‚Ä¢ Save often (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)

üí° TIPS:
‚Ä¢ Start simple, add complexity gradually
‚Ä¢ Playtest frequently to ensure fun gameplay
‚Ä¢ Get feedback from others early and often
‚Ä¢ Polish is important - small details matter!
‚Ä¢ Don't aim for perfection on first pass - iterate!
‚Ä¢ Performance matters on mobile - profile regularly

üéØ SCOPE MANAGEMENT:
‚Ä¢ Focus on core gameplay first
‚Ä¢ Add "nice to have" features after core is solid
‚Ä¢ It's better to have a small polished game than large unfinished one
‚Ä¢ You can always add more levels/features in updates

‚è±Ô∏è TIME MANAGEMENT:
‚Ä¢ Set realistic goals for each work session
‚Ä¢ Break large tasks into smaller ones
‚Ä¢ Track your progress in the game plan
‚Ä¢ Don't burnout - take breaks!
